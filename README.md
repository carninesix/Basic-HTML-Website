# Basic-HTML-Website
Part of the roadmap.sh projects

## Project URL
You can find more about this project description [here](https://roadmap.sh/projects/basic-html-website "roadmap.sh project page")

## Instructions to run
Clone the repository into your machine, then open the file `index.html` with your favorite browser to see the main page

## Notes
- The `articles.html` file is pretty much empty, which is _mostly_ by design, it will be updated once I think of something to add in there.
